# Git, Github and Bash - Title for README

Pretty good repo, huh. :)
This repo covers the following concepts/tools.
- Git
- Github
- Bash
- README files
- MarkDown or .md files


## Bash

Bash is a scripting language used by command line terminals.
We can use it to create files, navigate our computers or run programs.

### Basic Bash Commands
- ls
- rm



#Git
Git is version control.
Can go back and forth in time, and create separate branches of the same code which allows us to experiment.

### Basic commands:
0) git init
0) git status
0) git logs

1) git add
2) git commit -m 'meaningful message'


### What to do when you initiate a repo in the wrong place?
